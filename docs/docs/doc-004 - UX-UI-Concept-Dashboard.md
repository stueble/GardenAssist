# UI Concept – Dashboard

**Version:** 0.6  
**Last updated:** 2026-05-03

---

## 1. Purpose

The dashboard is the primary entry point of the application. It gives the user everything relevant at a glance: open and overdue tasks, the visual garden plan, and a seasonal monthly overview. The user should be able to act immediately — complete tasks, review the garden, and consult the AI assistant — without leaving this view.

---

## 2. Context & Placement

- **Accessed via:** App start (home / root route)
- **Part of:** Main navigation — first tab / default active state
- **Related views:**
  - Plant overview (clicking a plant symbol in the plan opens the detail panel inline in the left column)
  - Garden calendar (monthly band is a simplified version of it)
  - Journal (log entries linked to completed tasks)
  - AI assistant (embedded as a collapsible panel)

---

## 3. Design Principles (for this view)

- **Garden as the main character** – the visual center (garden plan) receives the largest share of the layout
- **Action over information** – task actions (✓ Done, → Skip) are directly visible, no extra click required
- **Organic aesthetic** – green tones, natural typefaces (Playfair Display + DM Sans), no hard edges
- **Contextual hover instead of dialogs** – details appear as tooltips, not modal overlays
- **Assistant always reachable** – the chat trigger is permanently visible, never hidden in a menu

---

## 4. Layout & Structure

The dashboard follows a 4-zone layout:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🌿 GardenAssist  [ Dashboard ][ Plants ][ Calendar ][ Journal ] │
├──────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┬───────┤
│  ☁️ 18°C         │                                       │       │
│  Mo Tu We Th Fr  │     Garden Plan                       │  💬   │
│  ──────────────  │     (central, interactive)            │       │
│  ⚠️ Warnings     │                                  ↕ ↔  │  ver- │
│  🔴 Todo 1  ✓ → ├───────────────────────────────────────┤  ti-  │
│  🟡 Todo 2  ✓ → │  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun …  Dec  │  cal  │
│  🔵 Todo 3  ✓ → │                                       │  strip│
└──────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┴───────┘
```

When a plant pin is clicked, the left column switches from todo list to plant detail:

```
├──────────────────┬─ …
│  ☁️ 18°C         │
│  Mo Tu We Th Fr  │
│  ──────────────  │
│  🌹 Rose         │

│  ┌──────────┐    │
│  │ Steckbr. │    │
│  └──────────┘    │
│  [💬 Ask] [✏️]   │
```

### Zones in Detail

| Zone | Width | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Navigation** (top) | 100% | Logo, main nav links, settings |
| **Left column** | ~280px | Weather widget (always) + divider + either todo list or plant detail panel |
| **Center area** | flex (remaining) | Interactive garden plan |
| **Monthly band** (bottom) | Center only | 12-month overview, aligned below the garden plan |

| **Garden plan** (center) | Image uploaded by the user, rendered as a pannable/zoomable layer with plant pins on top | Full pan & zoom (see interactions); image loaded from uploaded file `gartenplan.png` |
| **Plant pin** | Emoji + ring on the plan surface; red dot indicator for overdue tasks | Hover: tooltip with name, status, next task; first click: opens detail panel; second click on same pin: closes panel |
| **Zoom buttons ↕ / ↔** | Fixed bottom-right of garden area; toggleable — active button highlighted in dark green | ↕ active: image always scaled to fit available height, auto-updates on window resize; ↔ active: image always scaled to fit available width, auto-updates on window resize; both active: image stretched to fill entire area (distorted); both inactive: free zoom/pan mode; not affected by pan/zoom transform |

## 6. Interactions & States

### Interactions

- **Click ✓ (Done)** → Todo item animates out to the left (opacity 0 + translateX(-20px)), then `display: none`
- **Click → (Skip)** → Todo item animates out to the right
- **Click on todo text** → Chat panel opens with the task as implicit context
- **Click plant pin (first click)** → Plant detail panel slides in below weather widget, replacing todo list; pin gets green highlight ring
- **Click plant pin (second click on same pin)** → Detail panel closes, todo list returns
- **Click ✕ in detail panel** → Detail panel closes, todo list returns
- **Click "Ask assistant" in detail panel** → Chat panel opens; context pill for the selected plant injected
- **Hover over plant pin** → Tooltip: name, status, next task
- **Hover over month cell** → Tooltip appears above with categorized tasks
- **Click chat strip** → Chat panel expands (width transition), strip is hidden
- **Click ✕ in chat** → Chat panel collapses, strip reappears
- **Scroll wheel (both buttons inactive)** → Zoom in/out, centered on mouse position
- **Scroll wheel (↕ active, ↔ inactive)** → Pan left/right if image is wider than the container
- **Scroll wheel (↔ active, ↕ inactive)** → Pan up/down if image is taller than the container
- **Scroll wheel (both active)** → No function
- **Click + drag in garden plan** → Pan in all modes; cursor changes to grabbing hand
- **Pinch gesture (touch / trackpad)** → Two-finger zoom when both buttons inactive
- **Button ↕ (toggle)** → Activate: scale image to fit available height, center horizontally, auto-refit on window resize; deactivate: return to free mode (or fit-width if ↔ still active)
- **Button ↔ (toggle)** → Activate: scale image to fit available width, center vertically, auto-refit on window resize; deactivate: return to free mode (or fit-height if ↕ still active)
- **Both buttons active** → Image stretched to fill entire garden area (distorted); scrollwheel disabled; window resize re-applies stretch
- **Window resize with a button active** → Active mode re-applied immediately without going through the default fit-all calculation
- **Plant pins at any zoom level** → Counter-scaled (inverse of zoom) to remain constant visual size

### States

- **Default** – todo list visible, whole garden plan image visible (Math.min fit), current month highlighted
- **Plant detail open** – todo list hidden, detail panel visible below weather; selected pin highlighted
- **Empty state (no todos)** – todo list stays visible but empty; no special message or hide behavior
- **Empty state (no garden plan)** – center area shows CTA "Set up garden plan"
- **Loading state** – skeleton placeholders *(not yet defined)*
- **Error state** – *(not yet defined)*
- **Chat open** – chat panel expands from right; strip hidden

## 7. AI Assistant Integration

- **Contextual entry via todo:** Clicking a todo text opens the chat with the task as implicit context
- **Contextual entry via plant:** Clicking "Ask assistant" in the plant detail panel opens the chat with a context pill for that plant
- **Proactive hints:** The assistant can proactively address overdue tasks (e.g. "The roses have been on the list for a while…")
- **Data access:** The assistant has access to all garden data (plants, tasks, schedule) as context for all responses
- **Modification:** The assistant can mark tasks as done or add new tasks via natural language
- **Always reachable:** Chat strip permanently visible on the right edge — never hidden behind a menu

## 8. Responsive Behavior

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Desktop (>1200px) | Default layout as described above: Left–Center–Right |
| Tablet (768–1200px) | Left column collapses to drawer; plan fills more width |
| Mobile (<768px) | Not in scope for v1 |

---

## 9. Open Questions

- [ ] Where does weather data come from? Widget is implemented in the mockup but data source (API, mock, manual) is not yet decided.
- [ ] When the chat opens via todo click, should it auto-populate a message or just set context silently?

**Resolved:**
- [x] Garden plan is uploaded by the user as an image file.
- [x] When all todos are completed, the list stays visible but empty — no special message or auto-hiding.
- [x] The current month is always highlighted in the monthly band; the user cannot set a different active month.

## 10. Out of Scope for this View

- Full garden calendar / Gantt view (separate "Calendar" view)
- Manually creating tasks (handled via AI assistant or plant detail)
- Multi-user features
- Mobile-optimized layout (v1)
